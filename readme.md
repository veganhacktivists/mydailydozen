### Setting up the Project

This is a Laravel project using Yarn, Tailwind, Alpine, etc.

The easiest way to get this running for people working with us that we've found:

[Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop):

```bash
git clone git@github.com:veganhacktivists/mydailydozen.git
cd mydailydozen
cp .env.docker .env
git submodule update --init laradock
cd laradock
docker-compose exec workspace bash
composer install
php artisan migrate
php artisan db:seed
yarn install
yarn run watch
```

If you get stuck with the Docker try [here](https://laradock.io/getting-started/) or message on Discord.

There's a lot of ways to run Laravel. There's a lot of pluses and minuses to each. Here's some other options:
- [Vagrant / Homestead](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/homestead)
- [Mac](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/valet)
- [Linux](https://cpriego.github.io/valet-linux/)
- [Windows Alternative](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html)
